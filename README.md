The _hyperHTML_ strength & experience without its complexity üéâ

  * **faster** than [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML) ‚ö°Ô∏è
  * **simpler** than [lit-html](https://github.com/polymer/lit-html) üí°
  * fueling the [neverland](https://github.com/WebReflection/neverland/#neverland-) magic ü¶Ñ


### faster than hyperHTML

Even if sharing 90% of _hyperHTML_'s code, this utility removed all the not strictly necessary parts from it, including:

  * no `Component`, no `define` and/or intents, no `connect` or `disconnect`, and no promises <sup><sub>(possibly in later on)</sub></sup>, everything these days can be easily handled by hooks, as example using the [dom-augmentor](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom-augmentor) utility
  * html content is never implicit, since all you have to do is to write `html` before any template when you need it. However, the `{html: string}` is still accepted for extreme cases.

Removing these parts made the output smaller in size <sup><sub>(less than 6K)</sub></sup> but it also simplified some underlying logic.

Accordingly, _lighterhtml_ delivers raw [domdiff](https://github.com/WebReflection/domdiff#domdiff) and [domtagger](https://github.com/WebReflection/domtagger#domtagger) performance in an optimized way.

### simpler than lit-html

In _lit-html_, the `html` function tag is worthless, if used without its `render`.

In _lighterhtml_ though, the `html` tag can be used in the wild to create any, one-off, real DOM.

Strawberry on top, when used through its `render`, it automatically creates all the keyed performance you'd expect from _hyperHTML_ wires, without needing to manually address any reference: pain point defeated üçæ

"_but ... how?_", if you're asking, the answer is simple: _lighterhtml_ is based on the same [augmentor](https://github.com/WebReflection/augmentor#augmentor)'s hooks concept, followed by automatically addressed [hyperhtml-wire](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperhtml-wire#hyperhtml-wire)s, which in turns brings a battle tested solution for the [O(ND) Eugene W. Myers' Algorithm](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.6927&rep=rep1&type=pdf) based [domdiff](https://github.com/WebReflection/domdiff#domdiff), and its extra variations.


### How to import lighterhtml

Following, the usual multi import pattern behind every project of mine:

  * via global `lighterhtml` CDN utility: `<script src="https://unpkg.com/lighterhtml"></script>`, and `const {render, html, svg} = lighterhtml`
  * via ESM CDN module: `import {render, html, svg} from 'https://unpkg.com/lighterhtml?module'`
  * via ESM bundler: `import {render, html, svg} from 'lighterhtml'`
  * via CJS module: `const {render, html, svg} = require('lighterhtml')`


### What's the API ? What's in the export ?

The module exports the following:

  * `html` tag function, create as one-off any sort of html content, or wired content when used within a `render` call
  * `svg` tag function, create as one-off any sort of SVG content, or wired content when used within a `render` call
  * `render(node, fn)` to pollute a `node` with whatever is returned from the `fn` parameters, including `html` or `svg` tagged layout, as well as any real DOM content, if needed
  * `hook(useRef)` to provide hooks compatible `html` and `svg` utilities, using a `useRef(null)` reference to provide keyed updated per each component

You can test live a `hook` example in [this Code Pen](https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/maQXwq?editors=0010).


### A basic example

Live on [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/jXdBLV?editors=0010).

```js
import {render, html} from 'https://unpkg.com/lighterhtml?module';

document.body.appendChild(
  // as unkeyed one-off content, right away üéâ
  html`<strong>any</strong> one-off content!<div/>`
);

// as automatically rendered wired content ü§Ø
todo(document.body.lastChild);
function todo(node, items = []) {
  render(node, () => html`
  <ul>${items.map((what, i) => html`
    <li data-i=${i} onclick=${remove}> ${what} </li>
  `)}
    <button onclick=${add}> add </button>
  </uL>`);
  function add() {
    items.push(prompt('do'));
    todo(node, items);
  }
  function remove(e) {
    items.splice(e.currentTarget.dataset.i, 1);
    todo(node, items);
  }
}
```
